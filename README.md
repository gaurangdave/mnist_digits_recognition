# MNIST Digits Recognition

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end application that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The application will allow users to draw digits (or provide handwritten digit images) and predict the digit using a trained machine learning model. This involves:
1. Training a machine learning model to recognize digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.
1. Creating a user-friendly web application where:
	* Users can input a handwritten digit using a canvas or upload an image.
	* The application predicts the digit based on the trained model.

### Tools and Platforms:
1. **Google Colab**: Used for data exploration, training, and evaluation of the digit recognition model.  
2. **Python**: Primary programming language for machine learning, data preprocessing, and API development.  
3. **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and building classical ML models.  
4. **TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models (if needed for improved performance).  
5. **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations during the analysis phase.  
6. **FastAPI**: For exposing the trained model as an API and building backend services.
